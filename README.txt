Hello there :)

In order to run the program, issue the following commands:
	npm install
	npm start

The resulting out should look like this:
	Green Bay
	ID: ChIJ84CzCejiAogRcfXcFFIEcGM
	Latitude: 44.51915899999999
	Longitude: -88.019826

I've written comments throughout the 'main.js' file, explaining my thought process and how I would handle certain errors or prepare for future features. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
